## Steps of React
1. Render out hard coded data
2. Model your data (similar to the process in Rails)
3. Add state to your app
4. Make render use app's state (remove hard-coding from render)
5. Handle events from interactive elements (`onClick`, `onChange`)
6. Connect those two methods that update the app's state (`this.setState`)


## Models

### User
- first name
- last name
- profile image
